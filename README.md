# ScreenTranslate
On indefinite hiatus. Tool to translate text on screen.

The plan was to use this for manga translation (with the amazing translations of google translate). However, after spring of 2019 a test run showed that it was too slow to perform OCR (btw needs Tesseract OCR in the same folder).
